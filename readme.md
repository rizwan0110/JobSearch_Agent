# JOBAgent – AI Job Search Agent

## What is this project and why I am developing it?

JOBAgent is an AI-powered job search agent designed to automate the process of finding AI-related job opportunities. I am developing it to learn about AI agents, gain practical experience, assist in my job hunt, and potentially develop it into a product in the future.

## Why this Agent?

With the help of this agent, time can be saved by automating job discovery and filtering.

## How this agent works (Steps)

1. Fetch Jobs – Automatically collect AI-related job postings from Arbetsförmedlingen (Swedish Employment Service).

2. Save Jobs – Store the fetched jobs in a structured format.

3. Send Job Description to LLM – Forward job details to the AI model for analysis.

4. Analyze JD & User Profile – Compare job description with my skills and preferences.

5. Filter Matches – The LLM identifies jobs that closely match my profile.

6. Notify / Apply – If a match is found, an email is sent to apply.
